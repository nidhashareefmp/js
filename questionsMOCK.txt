what is the purpose of try catch statement 
The try...catch statement is used to handle errors in JavaScript gracefully, without stopping the execution of the entire program.
It allows you to test a block of code for errors (in try) and handle those errors (in catch) if they occur.

one event can be given multiple



what is the difference between queryselector query selectorAll
The purpose of querySelector() and querySelectorAll() in JavaScript is to select elements from the DOM (Document Object Model) using CSS selectors.

 querySelector()
It is used to select the first element in the document that matches a specified CSS selector.

Compares values only, not data types.
If the types are different, JavaScript will convert (coerce) them before comparing.

===
Compares both value and data type.
No type conversion happens.

what is hoisting
hoisting - calling a function before defining it
keyfeatures of fn declaration



what is 'this' keyword in js

fn expression - is a way to define a fn inside an expression and assign it to a variable

annonymous fn - function is definied without a name

what is the purpose of Let Var Const
var - Redeclaration: Allowed
      Reassignment: Allowed
let - Redeclaration: ❌ Not allowed in same scope
      Reassignment: ✅ Allowed
Const - Redeclaration: ❌ Not allowed
       Reassignment: ❌ Not allowed
     

difference between primitive and nonprimitive datatypes
primitive - Primitive data types are basic types that store single values and are immutable (cannot be changed).
           [String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt]

nonprimitive -    Non-primitive types are objects that store collections of values or more complex structures.
             [Object, Array, Function, Date, etc. ]
