// async marks a fn that will return a promise.

//fn declaration
async function hello() {
    
}
//fn expression
const sayBye = async function () {
    
}
//arrow fn
const sayHello = async () =>{

}


// await poses the fn execution until a promise is resolved.(or reject)
// it makes asynchronus code look and behave like synchronus code
